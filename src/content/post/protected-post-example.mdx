# Protected Content Example

This is an example of protected content that is only visible to logged-in users. If you're seeing this content, it means you have successfully authenticated.

## What's Inside?

This post demonstrates how to use the `protected` frontmatter property to restrict access to certain blog posts. This feature is useful for:

1. Premium content
2. Member-only articles
3. Internal documentation
4. Draft posts

## How It Works

When a post is marked with `protected: true` in its frontmatter, the content is automatically wrapped in a component that checks the user's authentication status. If the user is not logged in, they will see a message asking them to log in instead of the actual content.

## Security Considerations

Remember that this is a client-side protection mechanism. While it's suitable for most use cases, sensitive information should always be protected at the API level as well.
