## What is Protected Content?

Protected content is content that requires authentication to access. This could be:
- Premium articles
- Member-only tutorials
- Exclusive resources
- Private documentation

## Why Use Protected Content?

There are several reasons to protect certain content:
1. Premium content monetization
2. Member exclusivity
3. Internal documentation
4. Sensitive information protection

## How Does It Work?

When you try to access a protected post:
1. The system checks if you're logged in
2. If not, you're redirected to the login page
3. After logging in, you're redirected back to the protected content
4. The content is then displayed with a special lock icon
